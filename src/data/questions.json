    "answer": "The molecular clock hypothesis, proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling, suggests that amino acid substitutions in proteins accumulate at a relatively constant rate over evolutionary time. However, substitution rates may vary depending on the protein\u2019s functional importance. (10) Info: Proteins X and Y differ in both length and substitution rate. Protein X is 400 amino acids in length with a substitution rate of 0.625 x 10^-9 substitutions per site/year. Protein Y on the other hand is 600 amino acids long with a substitution rate of 1.25 x 10^-9 substitutions per site/year a. How many substitutions were expected to be accumulated at a maximum between human and mouse, which diverged 80 million years ago (MYA)? (4) Answer: X: 40 substitutions ; Y: 120 subsitutions +1 point for correct number of protein X substitutions +1 point for correct number of protein Y substitutions +2 points for proper work shown/any work shown with the info given is +1 Explanation of the work from writer: Protein X: Given: 400 amino acids, rate of 0.625 x 10^-9 subsitutions/site/year, and a divergence time of 80 million years (80 mil to sci notation would be 8.0 x 10^7, in the work shown below) X substitutions = 400 x 0.625 x 10^-19 x 2 x 8.0 x 10^7 = 40 Protein Y: Given the same info, except that the rate is 1.25 x 10^-19 Y substitutions = 600 x 1.25 x 10^-9 x 2 x 8.0 x 10^7 = 120 b. In Protein X, 6 amino acid substitutions were observed between human and a mammal species. What would be the divergence time between them? (2) This is exactly like how the work was shown for 41a, except THIS time you are given observed substitutions and are to solve for divergence time. 6 = 400 x 0.625 x 10^-9 x 2 x t (where t is just the divergence time) Answer: 12 MYA +1 point for correct answer +1 point for proper work shown with info given/any work is okay c. Insulin is first made as one long protein chain consisting of 110 amino acids. During processing, two parts are removed: a signal segment of 24 amino acids at the start and a middle segment of 31 amino acids. This leaves the primary active region of 55 amino acids, which functions as the mature insulin hormone. Rank the subsitution rates of each domain from highest to lowest. Justify your reasoning (4) (TB2) +1 point for correct ranking, must be ALL correct (signal domain > middle segment > primary active region) +1 point x3 for each of the explanations (justifications) - The signal segment is removed early during maturation and is less important for the final function, so it can tolerate more changes = highest substitution - The middle segment is also removed before insulin becomes active, but has a role during processing so its substitution rate is in the middle - The primary active region is the active part of insulin responsible for hormone function. Because it is so important it is heavily conserved and changes very slowly = lowest substitution rate",

    "question": "Before inserting recombinant plasmids into bacteria, it is important to check that your plasmids are the correct length. One way to do this is by running samples through a gel. You decide to perform a gel electrophoresis procedure on 5 samples from 5 containers of the same plasmid (1 individual sample per container in each lane). You ask your assistant to perform the procedure for you and come back to you with the results. When they return, they tell you that lanes 1, 3, 4, and 5 showed the expected results while lane 2 had a result indicating the plasmid had fewer base pairs. Much to your confusion, you perform Sanger sequencing on the sample from every lane and see the sequences in all lanes are identical. What is a possible reason lane 2\u2019s band does not match the expected results? Explain your answer. Note: Assume all lab procedures were done correctly and there was no contamination (or anything similar) throughout the process. (4)",

A few observations about the effects of this protein include that replication forks that typically are activated later in replication are activated earlier, resulting in a shortage of nucleotides, and DNA repair is chronically triggered and is dysfunctional, while LAP2\u03b1, which typically binds telomere ends to prevent DNA repair from being triggered, is unable to properly bind telomere ends because of Progerin. Using all of the above observations about Progeria cells, propose a possible mechanism through which Progeria can cause accelerated aging through its effects at the telomeres. (6pts) 15",

        "text": "Epistasis 15 Free Response I: The Hox Paradox of Ultrabithorax The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a commonly used model organism because of the plethora of genetic tools available. They are also notable for their role in the discovery of Hox genes, which encode transcription factors that control gene regulatory networks that determine body plan development. In this problem, we will investigate the use of balancer chromosomes, some genetic tools for investigating cell-type specific effects, and the role of the Hox transcription factor Ultrabithorax. One of the most critical parts of Drosophila is the maintenance of stable stocks that preserve the same genetics over many generations. For example, incorporating a transgene into a chromosome that can then recombine could lead to researchers losing track of what flies have the transgene and on which chromosome, which would not be ideal. Drosophila flies are diploid and have four chromosomes (3 autosomes and 1 sex chromosome). Typically only the 3 autosomes are used for genetic experiments and are denoted as follows: Chr1:allele 1 / Chr1: allele 2 ; Chr2: allele 1 / Chr2: allele 2 ; Chr3: allele 1 / Chr3: allele 2 In order to make sure the alleles are trackable, researchers use balancer chromosomes, which contain large inversions and also have phenotypic markers that allow them to be tracked visually both in the adult stage and in the larval stage. One common balancer fly is the following with the physical markers listed below: yw; Pin / CyO-GFP ; MKRS / TM6B, tb ; +/+ yw: red eyes Pin: thinner and slightly shorter hairs on the back of the adult thorax, no larval marker CyO-GFP: curly wings in the adult, expresses GFP during larval and adult stages MKRS: extremely short hairs on the back of the adult thorax, no larval marker TM6B: additional hairs on the humerus (shoulder) of the adult fly tb (tubby): a larval marker that causes pupa to become shorter"

    "question": "Why does the large inversion on balancer chromosomes prevent offspring from being homozygous for the balancer? Explain why no recombinant offspring are observed. (5 pts). One common genetic system in Drosophila is known as the UAS-Gal4 system to achieve cell-type specific control. In this system, the expression of a transcription factor derived from yeast, Gal4, is placed under the control of a cell-type specific enhancer. Gal4 can then bind to an upstream activating sequence (UAS) enhancer, which in turn drives the expression of another gene of interest, such as protein tagged with GFP. Commonly, fly lines containing the Gal4 only are crossed to lines containing the UAS-gene only. Individually, these fly lines behave normally since the Gal4 and UAS components are separated. Their progeny are then screened for those containing both Gal4 and UAS components, meaning that the system is properly combined and the gene of interest is being expressed.",

With the new collection, rather than \"pulling\" a random doll from a blind box, customers will be able to choose two dolls to be put into a machine (called \u201cThe LAB\u201d) which will generate a unique Labubu at the store. The technology of these new Labubus are similar to those of Mendelian genetics, where two parent dolls can generate offspring via The LAB. During the initial production of the Labubus at the factory, scientists give each Labubu genetic material that determines their phenotype. As one of the scientists on the team, you know that the Labubus are diploid and their fur color is determined by the molecular pathway outlined below. Assume loss-of-function alleles are all recessive and that one functional copy of Gene B can inhibit all of Gene A function. You decide to test out the technology using Labubus of known genotypes aaBbCc and AAbbCc. What color is each doll? Circle the correct answer(s) to complete the following statements: You put the two Labubus from part A into The LAB, producing a red Labubu. If you were to repeat the cross, what is the probability that the next Labubu is also red? Show your work.

Your Principal Investigator (PI) studies acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer where immature blood cells (\u201cblasts\u201d) fail to differentiate and continue proliferating.

At lab meeting, your PI adds the real challenge: \u201cLots of enzymes can act on multiple similar substrates in vitro. What matters biologically is the physiologically relevant substrate\u2014the one whose turnover actually drives the phenotype in cells. If we don\u2019t identify which FTO activity matters, we can\u2019t design targeted therapies or interpret mechanisms.\u201d For this case, assume FTO can remove a small chemical tag (a methyl group) from either:",

    "question": "[4 pts] Ten wild-type female zebrafish are crossed to ten male zebrafish which lack tails. This tailless phenotype is caused by a recessive mutation in the no tail (ntl) gene. Each female zebrafish only mates once and gives birth to 100 baby fish. Of the 1,000 total offspring, 200 lacked tails and 800 had tails. Given this, how many of the original female zebrafish were heterozygous? Blue-white screening is a molecular biology technique used to identify recombinant bacterial colonies.

    "answer": "[4 pts] Ten wild-type female zebrafish are crossed to ten male zebrafish which lack tails. This tailless phenotype is caused by a recessive mutation in the no tail (ntl) gene. Each female zebrafish only mates once and gives birth to 100 baby fish. Of the 1,000 total offspring, 200 lacked tails and 800 had tails. Given this, how many of the original female zebrafish were heterozygous? 4 females Only a Nn x nn cross has a chance (50%) to result in tailless offspring. If each cross generates 100 offspring, then you would need 4 crosses (100 * 0.5 * 4) to generate 200 tailless fish.

Controls: non-targeting gRNA control (to tes for off-target/exp editing effects), \u201cmock-transfection\u201d control, and (if using HDR) a template-only control. To verify knockout: PCR amplify and sequence the target locus to confirm indels; qPCR / Western blot to check for loss of mRNA / protein; functional assay if appropriate. For off-target assessment: use whole-genome sequencing (or targeted off-target site sequencing predicted by bioinformatics) in clones; perform phenotypic comparison with control clones; optionally use a Cas9 variant with higher specificity.

Expected Answer: Under Hardy\u2013Weinberg: p\u00b2 = 0.49, 2pq = 2 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.42, q\u00b2 = 0.09. So expected frequencies: AA = 0.49, Aa = 0.42, aa = 0.09. Observing deviations could be due to non-random mating (inbreeding or assortative mating), selection (one genotype has higher fitness), genetic drift (especially if population small), gene flow (migration), mutation, or sampling error. To test: assess mating patterns; measure fitness of genotypes; track allele frequencies over generations; use large sample size; test for population structure; estimate effective population size; test for recent migration; directly genotype large number of individuals. Expected Answer: A frameshift mutation alters the reading frame for all downstream codons, often producing a completely different (garbage) amino acid sequence and likely encountering a premature stop codon. This typically abolishes proper folding, disrupts functional domains, and often leads to truncated nonfunctional protein or nonsense-mediate mRNA decay. In contrast, a missense mutation near the C-terminus changes only one amino acid; if that region is outside critical functional domains, the protein may retain substantial function, making the phenotypic effect milder. Expected Answer: Possible reasons for low correct-insert yield: Vector recircularization without insert (ligase seals vector alone) \u2192 background. Insert ligated in wrong orientation (because overhangs are symmetric or compatible in both orientations). Inefficient ligation or transformation (low DNA purity, suboptimal ratio of vector:insert, low competent cell efficiency). To improve: dephosphorylate vector ends to reduce recircularization; use directional cloning (two different restriction enzymes to force orientation specificity); gel-purify insert and vector; optimize vector-to-insert molar ratio; use high-efficiency competent cells; screen larger number of colonies; use antibiotic and blue/white or negative selection to enrich correct clones; include negative control (vector only) to estimate background. 12/22/25, 3:14 PM scilympiad.com/hylas/Es/PrevTestAns?tid=000GX7 https://scilympiad.com/hylas/Es/PrevTestAns?tid=000GX7 5/7",

    "answer": "(2.00 pts) In a eukaryotic cell, you observe that a particular gene\u2019s pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced, giving rise to two isoforms: one including exon 3, and one skipping it. How might such alternative splicing evolve, and what evolutionary advantages might alternative splicing confer at the population or species level? Expected Answer: Epigenetics: heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. Mechanisms include: DNA methylation (e.g. CpG methylation), histone modification (acetylation, methylation, etc.), chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNAs (e.g. miRNAs, lncRNAs), and chromatin structure / 3D genome architecture. Experimental strategy: isolate genomic DNA and chromatin from diseased vs healthy tissue; perform bisulfite sequencing (or methylation array) for DNA methylation; perform ChIP-Seq for key histone marks (e.g. H3K27ac, H3K9me3); RNA-Seq to measure expression; perhaps ATAC-Seq / DNase-seq for chromatin accessibility. Correlate epigenetic modifications with gene Y expression differences. Use demethylating agents or histone-deacetylase inhibitors in cell-based models to test whether changes in epigeneti marks cause expression changes. Expected Answer: Data: collect nucleotide or protein sequences of the two genes and related homologs from several species; align sequences; build phylogenetic tree (e.g. maximum likelihood, Bayesian). Interpretation: if the two genes from different species group with orthologous genes (each clusters with its species\u2019 orthologs across species), that suggests speciation events \u2014 orthologs. If the two genes from the same species cluster together (forming a species-specific clade), that suggests a gene duplication within that lineage \u2014 paralogs. Additional support: synteny (conserved gene order), chromosome location, intron-exon structure, and similarity of non-coding regulatory regions. Expected Answer: Process: preload and normalize raw intensity data (background correction, log-transform, quantile normalization, etc.). Filter out low-quality/low-signal probes. Perform statistical tests (e.g. t-test or linear model for each gene) comparing conditions. Adjust for multiple comparisons (e.g. apply False Discovery Rate correction like Benjamini\u2013 Hochberg). Optionally, use more sophisticated modelling (limma package) to include batch effects or other covariates. Then set significance thresholds (e.g. adjusted p-value < 0.05 fold-change cut-off) to define differentially expressed genes. Validate key hits (e.g. by qPCR). Expected Answer: Evolution: alternative splicing may evolve via mutations in splice sites, regulatory sequences (enhancers/silencers), exon duplication/deletion, or changes in splicing factor expression/regulation. Isoforms may be preserved if they confer selective advantage.

    "answer": "(2.00 pts) Explain how random mutagenesis and targeted mutagenesis differ. Give an example of when each would be used. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? allows tissue-specific or developmental-stage\u2013specific isoforms; enables fine regulation of gene function; may facilitate adaptation by allowing organisms to respond flexibly to environmental changes; can mask deleterious mutations by modulating which isoform is expressed. Expected Answer: Mitochondrial inheritance: mitochondria (and their mtDNA) are inherited maternally because during fertilization the sperm\u2019s mitochondria are typically degraded or excluded; thus all mtDNA comes from the egg. Differences in evolutionary dynamics: mtDNA is haploid and doesn\u2019t recombine (or recombines very little), so its effective population size is smaller, making genetic drift stronger. Mutations can accumulate quickly, and deleterious mutations may be less efficiently purged. Also, heteroplasmy (mixture of mutant and wild-type mtDNA in a cell) adds complexity; selection may act at the organelle or cellular level. Expected Answer: Random mutagenesis: introducing mutations across the genome (or gene) without specific target (e.g. via chemical mutagens, UV, transposon insertions, error- prone PCR). Used to generate diversity, discover gene function, perform forward genetic screens. Advantages: unbiased, can reveal unexpected gene functions; high diversity. Disadvantages: many mutations are deleterious or irrelevant, mapping causative mutation is laborious, off-target effects, background noise. Targeted mutagenesis: precise modification at a chosen locus (e.g. via CRISPR-Cas9, homologous recombination, site-directed mutagenesis). Used to test specific hypotheses (e.g. change a residue, knock out gene, insert tag). Advantages: clean, precise, hypothesis-driven, minimal off-target changes. Disadvantages: may miss unanticipated effects elsewhere; needs knowledge of sequence and function; sometimes technical difficulty (efficiency, delivery, repair). \u00a9 2025 - powered by Scilympiad (https://scilympiad.com) | Tournaments (/hylas/Home/Subscribers?sort=t) | Support Us (/hylas/Give) Terms of Use (/ToS.html) | Privacy (/Privacy.html) | Cookie Policy (/CookiePolicy.html) | Support (/hylas/Support) | Contact (/hylas/Home/Contact) 12/22/25, 3:14 PM scilympiad.com/hylas/Es/PrevTestAns?tid=000GX7 https://scilympiad.com/hylas/Es/PrevTestAns?tid=000GX7 7/7",

What are the genotypes of the P generation ducks? Male Female aa Aa Solution: See completed table above (+1 for each correct genotype) Explanation: Since all of the F1 individuals are sparkly, we know that the P female is A . The F2 generation\u2019s phenotypes directly reflect the genotypes of the F1 females: the sparkly 50% were produced by Aa females, while the dull 50% were produced by aa females. Thus, the P generation constitutes an Aa \u00d7 aa cross, where the mother is Aa while the father is aa. (b) (2 points) Now suppose that dull is instead dominant to sparkly.

Male Female Aa aa Solution: See completed table above (+1 for each correct genotype) Explanation: The P female must be aa because all of the F1 individuals are sparkly. But since there is a 1:1 dull:sparkly ratio in the F2 generation, we know that the F1 females are 50% Aa (who produced the dull offspring) and 50% aa (who produced the sparkly offspring).

For full points, you must explain each of the following: (a) (2 points) What is the normal function of chiasmata, and what effects does their disruption lead to? Solution: Chiasmata are points where homologous chromosomes remain connected during meiosis I after crossing over (+1). Their disruption leads to nondisjunction mutations and reduced amounts of crossing over (+1). (b) (1 point) How would this mutation affect genetic diversity? Why? Solution: Decrease (+0.5), as there may be fewer crossing over events, leading to reduced genetic diversity in offspring (+0.5) (c) (2 points) Express the changes in allele frequencies through Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (in terms of p and q).

Additionally, if and only if the statement is false, write the single word that makes it incorrect, and write the single word that would make the statement true. (a) Realized heritability is sometimes greater than the true narrow-sense heritability of a trait. Solution: True (+1) Explanation: Experimental noise alone can lead to an estimate of realized heritability greater than the true narrow-sense heritability (among other factors). (b) Quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies can capture the broad-sense heritability of traits. Solution: False (+1). Incorrect part: broad (+1). Correct replacement: narrow (+1). Explanation: QTL studies associate variation in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to levels of a quantitative phenotype. Since dominance/epistatic effects can only be observed from whole genes and not individual SNPs, QTL studies effectively seek to uncover additive genetic effects on a trait. (c) Suppose trait A has a correlation coefficient of 0.6, calculated from comparing parents and their offspring. Trait B has the same correlation coefficient of 0.6, calculated from comparing cousins. Trait B has the higher heritability. Solution: True (+1) Explanation: Since cousins are more distantly related than parents/offspring, if we observe the same degree of correlation in traits A and B, variance in B should be more strongly governed by genetic factors (i.e., be more heritable) than variance in A.

Also, note that lacA is not necessary for lactose catabolism. Following that, \u2022 Down-promoter mutations are found in promoter, cause a decrease in the rate of transcription (farther from consensus sequence). Effectively prevents transcription of operon. Expect none of the down-promoter strain to be expressed, but lacI works fine. \u2022 Nonsense mutation in lacZ is functionally equivalent to a lacZ- mutation, as the polycistronic mRNA nonsense doesn\u2019t affect downstream start/stop codons \u2022 Intergenic suppressor mutation occurs in different gene, restores function \u2022 Frameshift mutation in middle of lacY makes lacY and lacA products nonfunctional \u2022 Constitutively active lac repressor causes no transcription even in presence of lactose Page 30 of 33 Designer Genes MIT Science Olympiad \u2022 Neutral mutation in lacY has functionally no change Easy points: \u2022 Last row must be all 1, because it is functionally like a wild type lac operon, and no mutations in the columns are trans-acting \u2022 Constitutively active lac repressor row must be all 0 except for lacO-, because it prevents transcription of all operons except in the case of lacO- where it cannot bind lac operon \u2022 lacO- column must be all 1, because the repressor is irrelevant when grown in a lactose medium \u2022 lacP- column must all be 0, because all mutations in the rows cause some form of nonfunctionality, and lacP- completely prevents transcription of otherwise functional structural genes, preventing any rescue of catabolism \u2022 lacI- column is all 1 except for constitutively active lac repressor because repressor is irrelevant when grown in a lactose medium \u2022 CAP site column is all 0 except for last row because no CAP bound causes no transcription",

E. coli will be our model organism. (a) To start, bacteria must recognize promoters and initiate transcription. i. (3 points) Describe the canonical bacterial promoter elements, including consensus sequences and positions relative to the TSS. What is the significance of the spacing between these elements? Solution: The -10 element (Pribnow box) is the consensus sequence TATAAT (+1). The -35 element is the consensus sequence TTGACA (+1). Spacing is 17 \u00b1 1 bp, which allows them to be on the same face of the DNA helix and recognition by RNAP (+1). ii. (2 points) How does the bacterial sigma factor recognize and bind to promoter elements? Solution: Contains a consensus sequence for the promoter (+1). Aromatic amino acids in particular aid in destabilizing dsDNA (+1). (b) RNA polymerase then binds to the promoter and other related sequences. i. (2 points) Explain the structural transitions that occur as RNA polymerase moves from the closed complex to the open complex to the elongation complex. What happens to the sigma factor during this transition? Solution: Sigma factor is released from RNAP and is released from the transcription complex (+1).

[2] Gene editing is often used to explore the structure and function of proteins. For example, changes can be made to the coding sequence of a gene to determine how alterations in the amino acid sequence affect the function of a protein. Let\u2019s suppose that you are interested in the functional importance of a particular glutamic acid (an amino acid) within a protein you are studying. By gene editing, you make mutant proteins in which the glutamic acid has been changed to other amino acids. You then test the mutant proteins for functionality. The results are as follows: From these results, what would you conclude about the functional significance of this glutamic acid within the protein? [2] Describe the rationale underlying the technique of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. [2] Which of the following is the correct function of bacterial transcriptional elongation factor?

Several profiles of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cell line were run through chip-seq and chip-chip. Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2641 What profiles are the different colored peaks measuring? [1] What is the difference in profiles of chip-chip and chip-seq, and what does it mean?

[2] List the general eight steps of Hi-C sequencing. [1] Chromosome conformation capture is a key genomic proximity ligation method utilized in Hi-C. However, there are different types. What are the advantages and disadvantages to 3C, 4C, 5C, and Hi-C? [3] What\u2019s the procedure of a RNA-seq? [2] Mendelian genetics! Gregor Mendel\u2019s Law of Independent Assortment states that genes on different chromosomes segregate independently into gametes. However, when genes are linked, they do not follow this law strictly, and this linkage can be broken by recombination. Suppose a gene A and gene B are located on the same chromosome but 50 megabases apart. In a mapping population, you observe fewer recombinant offspring than expected under true independence. Which of the following is the most plausible genetic explanation for this observation? [1] The two genes experience crossover interference, so a crossover in one region reduces the chance of another nearby. The genes are separated by a large physical distance, but centromeric suppression of crossing over occupies the intervening region. There is negative epistasis between A and B that reduces viability of recombinant gametes. A large inversion exists between A and B preventing recombination in many meioses. The recombinant gametes are formed but suffer meiotic drive against them. Mendel\u2019s Law of Segregation implies that alleles of a gene separate equally into gametes. But several biological phenomena can violate or bias segregation. Which of the following can cause a deviation from the expected 1:1 allele ratio in gametes? Select all that apply: [1] Meiotic drive elements that bias inclusion of one chromosome over its homolog Centromeric \u201csegregation distorters\u201d that interfere with normal segregation machinery Gene conversion during meiosis converting one allele into another Linked lethal alleles that kill gametes carrying one allele Incomplete dominance at a locus altering phenotypic ratios in offspring Mendel\u2019s Third Law (Law of Dominance) assumes alleles are either completely dominant or recessive. Real biology often violates that with incomplete dominance, codominance, or overdominance. In a cross between two plants with red and white flower alleles, the F\u2081 all show pink flowers. In the F\u2082 you observe 1 red : 2 pink : 1 white. This is a classic pattern of _______. [1] Incomplete dominance When you cross two pea plants, each heterozygous for a single gene controlling seed color (Yy \u00d7 Yy), you get a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F\u2082 generation. Suppose instead you cross a plant that is heterozygous for Y (Yy) and for height (Tt) with a homozygous recessive plant (yytt). Which of the following Punnett square genotypic / phenotypic expectations is correct? [1] You set up a 4\u00d74 square with gametes YT, Yt, yT, yt vs yt; you will get 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. You should get a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio because each gamete from YyTt (YT, Yt, yT, yt) has an equal chance and when crossed with only yt, they produce equal classes. You can do two independent monohybrid squares and multiply results; you\u2019ll end up with 3/16 showing dominant for both traits, 3/16 dominant Y only, 3/16 dominant T only, and 1/16 recessive for both. The cross YyTt \u00d7 yytt gives phenotypic ratio 1 dominant Y + dominant T : 1 dominant Y only : 1 dominant T only : 1 recessive both. None of the above You perform a trihybrid cross (AaBbCc \u00d7 AaBbCc) assuming complete dominance at each locus and independent assortment. Which of the following phenotypic ratios or statements about the F\u2082 generation are TRUE? (Select all that apply) The total number of genotype combinations in F\u2082 is 64. The phenotypic ratio across all 8 phenotype classes is 27 : 9 : 9 : 9 : 3 : 3 : 3 : 1. Each of the 8 phenotype classes corresponds to a unique genotype. You could equivalently compute probabilities by doing three independent monohybrid 1:2:1 crosses and multiplying probabilities. A full 8\u00d78 Punnett square is the only valid way to compute F\u2082 outcomes correctly. A three-generation pedigree shows an affected male (proband) whose mother is unaffected, father is unaffected, and the proband has an affected maternal uncle (mother\u2019s brother). Affected individuals are predominantly male; some daughters of unaffected parents are carriers but usually unaffected. Which inheritance model is most consistent with this pedigree? [1] Autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance Autosomal recessive with consanguinity X-linked recessive Mitochondrial inheritance X-linked dominant When evaluating a pedigree to decide whether a trait is autosomal dominant (AD) vs autosomal recessive (AR) vs X-linked recessive (XR), which of the following observations are valid indicators (pick all that apply)? [1] If the trait appears in every generation, it suggests autosomal dominant. If two unaffected parents have an affected child, it suggests autosomal recessive or de novo dominant. If affected fathers transmit the trait to all daughters but no sons, it suggests X-linked recessive. If the trait shows equal frequency in males and females, it rules out X-linked inheritance. If only males are affected across multiple generations and mothers are often carriers, this suggests X-linked recessive. A pedigree shows a single affected male (the proband). His mother is phenotypically unaffected, and she has one affected brother. The father of the proband is unaffected and has no affected relatives. Assume the trait is a single-gene disorder with full penetrance when hemizygous/ homozygous and that the population allele frequency is very low (so ignore unrelated carrier probability). [4] Fill in the blanks below (A\u2013D) with the best answers. The most likely mode of inheritance for this pedigree is (A). The locus is most likely located on the (B) chromosome type. The most likely genotype of the proband\u2019s mother (who is unaffected) is (C). The probability that an unaffected daughter of the proband (assuming she is phenotypically normal and the other parent is unrelated and unaffected) is a carrier is (D). (A) X-linked recessive (B) X chromosome (X-linked) (C) heterozygous carrier (commonly written X\u1d2cX\u1d43 where X\u1d43 = disease allele) (D) 100% In mice, coat color is determined by two loci: C (pigment production: C = functional, c = albino) and B (black vs brown pigment when pigment is produced: B = black, b = brown). The c allele is epistatic to B, meaning that if an animal is cc, no pigment is produced regardless of the B locus genotype. You cross CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. What phenotypic ratio do you expect in the F\u2082 generation? [1] 9 black : 3 brown : 3 albino : 1 albino 9 black : 3 brown : 4 albino 12 albino : 3 black : 1 brown 9 black : 4 albino : 3 brown 9 black : 7 albino : 0 brown Epistasis complicates predictions of genotypic and phenotypic ratios in genetic crosses. Which of the following statements about epistasis and its implications are true? (Select all that apply.) [1] Epistasis can mask the phenotypic effects of alleles at another locus. In recessive epistasis, homozygosity at the epistatic locus masks the phenotype regardless of the second locus. Epistasis always reduces phenotypic diversity in an F\u2082 cross. When epistasis exists, 17:3 and 13:3 ratios are sometimes observed in F\u2082 phenotypes under certain genetic interactions. Epistasis may make two loci behave as if they are in a single locus in a Punnett-square prediction. A trihybrid heterozygote AaBbCc (phase unknown) was testcrossed to aabbcc. The observed progeny (each phenotype corresponds to a gamete from the trihybrid parent) are: [3] Total progeny = 860 Infer gene order, compute map distances between the three genes, and estimate interference. For questions 54-56, use the original mapping function formulas for Haldane (1919) and Kosambi (1944), both of which convert recombination frequency (r) into map distance (d) in centiMorgans. Haldane function: d = -\u00bd ln(1-2r); inverse function: r = \u00bd (1-e-2d) Kosambi function: d = \u00bc ln((1+2r)/(1-2r)); inverse function: r = 1/2tanh(2d) In a genetic cross, the observed recombination frequency between two genes is 0.20 (20%). Using the Haldane mapping function, the corrected map distance in centimorgans (cM) is ___________ cM, while using the Kosambi mapping function, it is ____________ cM. Between these two corrections, the ________________ function generally gives a shorter map distance at high recombination frequencies because it accounts for _____________________________. For two intervals, the observed recombination frequencies are 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. Calculate the total corrected map distance (A \u2192 C) under both mapping functions. Fill in the blanks: [2] Using the Haldane function: DH = Using the Kosambi function: DK = When the observed recombination frequency between two loci is > 0.25, the Haldane correction yields a map distance that increases (faster/slower) than the observed recombination rate, while the Kosambi correction increases (faster/slower). This difference reflects the biological reality that crossover events are ____________________, not purely _____________________________. [4] Mitosis & Meiosis During mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached. Which protein complex directly inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to delay anaphase? [1] Cohesin complex Condensin complex Mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) Cyclin B/CDK1 Shugoshin Which of the following are functions of the spindle assembly checkpoint?

[1] The phragmoplast directs vesicles to build the cell plate Plants have centrosomes identical to animal cells The preprophase band persists throughout mitosis MiMe system occurs naturally in all plants Closed mitosis is the norm in all higher plants The MiMe system in Arabidopsis leads to: [1] Production of diploid gametes via meiosis Production of clonal diploid gametes via mitosis instead of meiosis Polyploid somatic embryos Haploid gametes with increased recombination Formation of apomictic seeds with sexual reproduction During early B cell development in the bone marrow, the assembly of functional immunoglobulin heavy chain genes requires the coordinated action of the recombination-activating gene products RAG1 and RAG2, which recognize conserved recombination signal sequences (RSS) flanking V, D, and J gene segments. This process involves the generation of DNA double-strand breaks, hairpin formation at coding ends, and repair predominantly through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Considering this intricate molecular process, which of the following statements most accurately describes a critical feature of V(D)J recombination that contributes to antigen receptor diversity? The RAG complex introduces single-strand nicks exclusively at the 3\u2032 end of coding sequences, producing staggered ends that are subsequently ligated by homologous recombination machinery, and this mechanism ensures precise sequence conservation across all B cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) adds non-templated nucleotides at the coding junctions after hairpin opening, increasing junctional diversity, while the RAG complex recognizes conserved RSS with a strict 12/23 rule to prevent inappropriate segment joining. Class switch recombination occurs simultaneously with V(D)J rearrangement, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for initiating double-strand breaks within V, D, and J segments, thereby increasing combinatorial diversity. Allelic exclusion is primarily dictated by TdT activity, which ensures that only one allele undergoes somatic hypermutation, thereby preventing expression of multiple heavy chain variants within a single B cell clone. Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) enables B cells to replace the constant region of the heavy chain, allowing the same antigen specificity to be expressed with different effector functions. CSR is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which deaminates cytosines within switch (S) regions upstream of constant region exons. These uracil lesions are processed into DNA double-strand breaks that are subsequently repaired through non-homologous end joining, often influenced by 53BP1 and other DNA damage response factors. Given these molecular events, which of the following statements best reflects the determinants of CSR specificity and efficiency? CSR exclusively targets V region exons and is independent of transcriptional activity or cytokine signaling, with AID recruitment occurring randomly across the genome, resulting in frequent off-target effects. The presence of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at S regions enhances AID recruitment and ensures uniform switching between IgM and all other isotypes without bias, while the repair is mediated solely by homologous recombination pathways. Germline transcription of the target S region, influenced by cytokine signaling (e.g., IL-4 for IgE, TGF-\u03b2 for IgA), establishes chromatin accessibility that directs AID-mediated deamination, and the resolution of DSBs by classical NHEJ determines the predominant isotype outcome. Class switch recombination is initiated exclusively by TdT activity at the V(D)J junction, which both introduces junctional diversity and triggers recruitment of the MRN complex to downstream S regions, thereby coordinating heavy chain switching with somatic hypermutation. During lymphocyte development, junctional diversity generated by nucleotide addition and exonuclease trimming at V(D)J coding joints is a key determinant of the antigen-binding repertoire. TdT activity introduces non-templated nucleotides at coding ends, while exonuclease trimming can remove nucleotides from gene segments prior to ligation. Furthermore, the enforcement of allelic exclusion ensures that only one heavy chain allele and one light chain allele are functionally expressed in each B cell, preventing simultaneous expression of multiple antigen receptor specificities. In this context, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the interplay between these molecular mechanisms in shaping the functional B cell repertoire? TdT-mediated addition of non-templated nucleotides and limited exonuclease trimming at V(D)J junctions increases combinatorial diversity, while feedback inhibition of RAG expression upon successful rearrangement enforces allelic exclusion at the heavy chain locus. Somatic hypermutation of the V region occurs prior to V(D)J recombination, ensuring maximal junctional diversity and allowing RAG1/2 to initiate class switching in the absence of AID. Allelic exclusion is determined entirely by chromatin looping that positions one allele outside the transcriptionally active nuclear compartment, with TdT activity being redundant for generating functional diversity. Junctional diversity is generated only in T cells and does not contribute to B cell antigen specificity, which relies exclusively on combinatorial V(D)J segment selection. Class switch recombination relies on activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which deaminates cytosines in switch (S) regions upstream of constant region exons. The resulting uracils are processed into double-strand breaks that are repaired by NHEJ, allowing recombination between S regions and enabling expression of different Ig isotypes. Which statement best describes the regulation and outcome of AID-mediated CSR? AID randomly deaminates cytosines across the genome, initiating CSR without regard for transcriptional activity or cytokine signaling. CSR is targeted to actively transcribed S regions, with cytokines such as IL-4 or TGF-\u03b2 directing isotype choice, and DSB repair by NHEJ finalizes recombination. AID initiates recombination at V(D)J coding segments during B cell development, ensuring junctional diversity before heavy chain isotype switching. TdT activity replaces the AID function during CSR to insert non-templated nucleotides in S regions, which dictates IgG versus IgA expression. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations into the variable regions of Ig genes at rates ~10-3 per base pair per division, increasing antigen-binding diversity. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) converts cytosines to uracils, which are then processed by error-prone repair pathways. Which statement best describes the SHM mechanism? SHM occurs in constant regions and is initiated by TdT to diversify heavy chain isotypes. SHM targets V region exons via AID-mediated cytosine deamination, followed by error-prone base excision and mismatch repair, generating point mutations that alter antigen specificity. SHM occurs before V(D)J recombination and is required to generate functional heavy chains. AID introduces deletions in S regions to trigger hypermutation exclusively in the light chain loci. AID initiates class switch recombination by deaminating cytosines in switch (S) regions, creating U:G mismatches that are processed into double-strand breaks. These breaks are repaired by NHEJ, allowing recombination between S regions. Which statement accurately describes how AID contributes to Ig isotype diversity? AID randomly mutates V(D)J exons to generate diversity before CSR. AID functions exclusively in T cells to promote TCR diversity. AID replaces the TdT function during V(D)J recombination to insert non-templated nucleotides in S regions. AID targets transcribed S regions, guided by cytokine-induced germline transcription, leading to isotype-specific DSB formation and recombination. Regulators and contributors to AID activity in CSR: Germline transcription of S regions Cytokines directing isotype choice Recruitment of 53BP1 and ATM for DSB repair TdT-mediated junctional addition at V(D)J ends Chromatin accessibility via histone modifications Switch regions are repetitive DNA sequences upstream of constant region exons that guide class switch recombination. The DNA is targeted by AID, and repair of DSBs leads to replacement of C\u03bc with downstream C\u03b3, C\u03b5, or C\u03b1 exons. Which statement correctly describes S region function? S regions provide repetitive DNA targets for AID-mediated deamination, facilitating DSB formation and recombination between different constant region exons. S regions encode variable region diversity and are not involved in CSR. S regions are transcribed only after B cell activation, without influence on CSR specificity. S regions are bound by TdT to introduce N-nucleotide diversity during isotype switching. During B cell development, light chain recombination occurs sequentially, with \u03ba locus rearranged before \u03bb locus. The choice of light chain affects antigen receptor specificity, allelic exclusion, and receptor editing if initial rearrangement is non-productive. Which statement accurately describes the molecular basis of \u03ba versus \u03bb recombination? \u03ba light chain genes are preferentially rearranged first, with \u03bb rearrangement occurring only if \u03ba alleles fail, and RAG1/2-mediated cleavage follows the 12/23 rule at V\u03ba and J\u03ba segments. \u03bb light chain rearrangement occurs prior to \u03ba rearrangement in all B cells to maximize receptor diversity. \u03ba and \u03bb loci recombine simultaneously in the same B cell, and TdT activity enforces allelic exclusion between them. \u03bb light chain genes are only expressed in memory B cells after somatic hypermutation of \u03ba chains. During affinity maturation, (A) introduces mutations in (B), B cells with improved (C) are selected in (D), and (E) ensures expansion of high-affinity clones. [4] (A) AID, (B) V region exons, (C) antigen-binding affinity, (D) germinal centers, (E) clonal expansion Population and Evolutionary Genetics Which of the following events violate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumptions and can alter allele frequencies? Genetic drift in small populations Selection for specific genotypes Non-random mating such as inbreeding Migration introducing new alleles Mutation introducing new alleles In a population of 1000 individuals, allele A has frequency p = 0.6 and allele a has frequency q = 0.4. Under HWE, the expected genotype counts are: AA = (A), Aa = (B), aa = (C). If selection removes 50% of AA individuals, new allele frequency of A becomes (D). [4] In an F2 population, mean of parents = 100, F1 mean = 110, F2 variance = 36, environmental variance = 9. Broad-sense heritability H\u00b2 = (A), narrow-sense heritability h\u00b2 = (B), number of contributing loci estimated = (C), expected F2 range = (D). Gene duplication provides raw material for evolution; duplicated genes may diverge to create paralogs, while orthologs exist between species. Which statement correctly describes this evolutionary mechanism? Only orthologs can generate new gene functions. Gene duplication creates paralogs within a genome; divergence can produce new functions, while orthologs retain function across species. Paralogs are identical copies without divergence. Duplication events have no evolutionary consequences. Gene duplication generates (A), which can diverge into (B) with new functions, while (C) maintains function across species. Evolutionary fates include (D) and (E). For constructing phylogenies, sequences from (A) inform biparental evolution, (B) inform maternal/paternal lineages, and (C) indicate (D). Proper marker selection considers (E) such as mutation rates and conservation. Essential steps in phylogenetic reconstruction: Sequence alignment to identify homologous positions Selection of evolutionary model (e.g., Jukes-Cantor, GTR) Inference of tree using distance, parsimony, or likelihood methods Bootstrapping or posterior probabilities to evaluate support Removing negligible gaps in sequences In a population of Arabidopsis thaliana, researchers are studying leaf size, a quantitative trait influenced by multiple genes. The total phenotypic variance in leaf size is observed to be Vp = 100, with additive genetic variance Va = 40 and dominance plus epistatic variance Vd + Vi = 20. To increase leaf size, the scientists select the largest plants from the population, resulting in a selection differential S = 10. After one generation, the average increase in leaf size (response to selection) R = 6. Calculate the following: Broad-sense heritability H\u00b2 = (A) Narrow-sense heritability h\u00b2 = (B) Realized heritability h\u00b2 = (C) Proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive effects = (D) A small island population of Gal\u00e1pagos finches is founded by 10 birds from a mainland population. One allele, A, controls beak depth and is initially at frequency p=0.8. After a few generations, what is a likely consequence of random sampling in this small population? If a hurricane kills half of the population randomly, how does allele frequency change? Researchers are constructing a phylogeny of wild tomato species using nuclear genes, mitochondrial sequences, and plasmid-derived sequences from bacterial endophytes. Which type of sequence reflects maternal lineage? Which sequence may indicate horizontal gene transfer? Which is best for general species-level phylogeny? In a controlled experimental evolution study, researchers are investigating floral scent intensity in a population of Nicotiana attenuata (wild tobacco), a trait influenced by multiple loci, epistatic interactions, and environmental cues such as temperature and soil nutrient availability. Over several generations, they measure phenotypic variance (Vp) in volatile compound emission, and partition it into additive genetic variance (Va), dominance variance (Vd), and epistatic variance (Vi) using a combination of full-sib/half-sib crossing designs and replicated common garden experiments. The researchers then perform directional selection for increased emission of benzyl acetone, calculating the selection differential (S) and the resulting response to selection (R) after one generation. Vp = 120 (ng/flower/hr)2 Va = 50 (ng/flower/hr)2 Vd + vi = 30 (ng/flower/hr)2 Selection differential S = 8 ng/flower/hr Observed response to selection R = 4.8 ng/flower/hr Calculate the broad-sense heritability (H\u00b2) of benzyl acetone emission. Calculate the narrow-sense heritability (h\u00b2). Calculate the realized heritability (h\u00b2 realized) from the selection experiment. Discuss why heritability is not necessarily constant across different soil nutrient environments, even though the study assumes a common garden. Explain why a high heritability estimate does not imply the trait is unaffected by environmental variation, especially under fluctuating field conditions. Molecular Biology of DNA The termination of replication in prokaryotes is controlled by: Tus proteins bound to Ter sites Origin recognition complex (ORC) Okazaki fragment ligation Telomerase reduction The energy for nucleotide addition comes from: Hydrolysis of dNTP triphosphate bonds ATP provided by helicase GTP hydrolysis NAD+ oxidation Euchromatin is characterized by: Active transcription and open chromatin structure Dense methylation and inactivity Heterochromatic histone modifications Nucleosome compaction Homologous recombination repair is primarily used to: Replace methylated bases Repair double-strand breaks using a sister chromatid Repair UV damage Add telomeric repeats A nonsense mutation leads to: Premature stop codon Amino acid substitution Synonymous codon Chromosomal fusion During eukaryotic DNA replication initiation, the loading of the MCM helicase complex is restricted to the G1 phase primarily because: Cdc6 and Cdt1 bind to ORC throughout S-phase Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate licensing factors preventing reloading after origin firing Geminin dephosphorylation stabilizes the MCM complex DDK activation promotes premature replisome collapse Replication licensing ensures that: Both sister chromatids are unwound simultaneously DNA repair occurs before transcription Topoisomerase activity is synchronized with helicase unwinding Each origin fires only once per cell cycle The eukaryotic replisome maintains coordination between leading and lagging strand synthesis by: Using a sliding clamp (PCNA) tethered to both polymerase \u03b4 and polymerase \u03b5 Alternating polymerase \u03b2 and polymerase \u03b3 activity Using RNA polymerase as a primase substitute Continuously synthesizing both strands without Okazaki fragments In E. coli, the \u03c4 subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme functions to: Dimerize the core polymerases and coordinate leading/lagging strand synthesis Increase helicase ATPase activity and coordinate leading/lagging strand synthesis Load the \u03b2-clamp at the origin and coordinate leading/lagging strand synthesis Catalyze RNA primer synthesis and coordinate leading/lagging strand synthesis The RNA primer removal during Okazaki fragment processing is mediated primarily by: FEN1 endonuclease and RNase H DNA ligase I DNA polymerase \u03b1\u2019s proofreading activity Topoisomerase II cleavage During replication stress caused by unrepaired DNA lesions, cells can maintain replication fork progression through a process known as translesion synthesis (TLS). Which of the following best describes the molecular strategy used in TLS? Activation of the canonical mismatch repair pathway to excise and replace damaged bases before fork restart Recruitment of specialized polymerases with relaxed base-pairing stringency that transiently replace the replicative polymerase to synthesize past the lesion Fork reversal and template switching using the nascent lagging strand to bypass the lesion site Recognition of bulky DNA adducts by nucleotide excision repair factors prior to DNA synthesis Monoubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at lysine-164 primarily facilitates which of the following cellular responses to replication-blocking DNA lesions? Ubiquitin-mediated disassembly of the CMG helicase complex to terminate fork progression Exchange of the replicative polymerase for specialized translesion polymerases to allow synthesis past the lesion site Recruitment of global genomic nucleotide excision repair factors to remove bulky adducts ahead of the fork Polyubiquitin-dependent signaling for template switching and homologous recombination repair During translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), several Y-family and B-family polymerases cooperate to bypass diverse DNA lesions. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the distinct but coordinated roles of Pol \u03b7, \u03b9, \u03ba, and \u03b6 in lesion bypass? Pol \u03b7 initiates homologous recombination at stalled forks, Pol \u03b9 excises oxidative lesions, Pol \u03ba catalyzes Okazaki fragment maturation, and Pol \u03b6 mediates mismatch repair during S phase. Pol \u03b7 and Pol \u03ba remove damaged bases via glycosylase activity, while Pol \u03b9 and Pol \u03b6 function in RNA primer elongation during leading strand synthesis. Pol \u03b7 synthesizes RNA primers for replication restart, Pol \u03b9 facilitates helicase loading, Pol \u03ba generates template switching intermediates, and Pol \u03b6 ligates Okazaki fragments. Pol \u03b7 accurately replicates across UV-induced thymine dimers, Pol \u03b9 inserts incorrect nucleotides opposite minor groove lesions, Pol \u03ba extends from mismatched termini, and Pol \u03b6 (Rev3/Rev7 complex) completes synthesis past the lesion. In E. coli, termination of transcription at a Rho-dependent terminator requires the Rho factor to bind to a rut site and translocate along the nascent RNA until it catches up with RNA polymerase (RNAP). Which of the following describes a key mechanistic distinction between Rho-dependent and Rho-independent terminators? Rho-independent termination uses Rho to hydrolyze ATP at the RNA exit channel, but Rho-dependent termination depends exclusively on intrinsic hairpin sequences. Rho-dependent termination happens only at promoters, while Rho-independent termination happens at terminators. Rho-independent terminators rely on a GC-rich inverted repeat forming a hairpin immediately upstream of a U-rich tract, causing RNAP pausing and release of the transcript, whereas Rho-dependent termination requires ATP-driven translocation of Rho along RNA to destabilize the transcription complex. Rho-independent termination requires translation of the RNA, whereas Rho-dependent termination functions on RNAs not being translated. LacI is a (A) tetramer that binds (B) to repress transcription of the lac operon. Binding of inducer (allolactose or IPTG) to LacI causes an (C) conformational change, reducing its operator affinity. In absence of inducer, E. coli also uses (D) (via CRP-cAMP) to regulate RNAP binding. During repression, (E) may form via binding between operator sites to loop DNA. Which features are typical of bacterial riboswitches? Recruitment of polymerase for replication Riboswitch-mediated activation of DNA repair Aptamer domain that binds ligand Expression platform that forms alternate secondary structures Regulation at either transcriptional or translational level The Sec and Tat translocation systems in bacteria mediate protein export across the cytoplasmic membrane but differ in their energy coupling and substrate handling. Which statement most accurately captures their mechanistic distinction? The Sec system engages SecA ATPase and SecYEG channels to thread nascent or partially folded polypeptides through the membrane, whereas the Tat system recognizes N-terminal twin-arginine motifs to translocate pre-folded substrates using the proton motive force. The Sec complex utilizes GTP hydrolysis to drive export of folded proteins, while Tat relies solely on passive diffusion of unfolded substrates. Both Sec and Tat depend on the proton motive force, but Tat uniquely requires cotranslational ribosome tethering for transport initiation. Sec and Tat differ primarily in their targeting sequences\u2014Tat uses a leucine-rich signal peptide lacking arginine residues, while Sec signals contain the twin-arginine consensus.

[2] Only the genes of interest make up the majority; initially, starting strands contain long chromosomal DNA that also gets replicated, but after several cycles, they are reduced. Gene editing is often used to explore the structure and function of proteins. For example, changes can be made to the coding sequence of a gene to determine how alterations in the amino acid sequence affect the function of a protein. Let\u2019s suppose that you are interested in the functional importance of a particular glutamic acid (an amino acid) within a protein you are studying. By gene editing, you make mutant proteins in which the glutamic acid has been changed to other amino acids. You then test the mutant proteins for functionality. The results are as follows: From these results, what would you conclude about the functional significance of this glutamic acid within the protein? [2] You would conclude that it might be important. The only amino acid substitution that gave a substantial amount of functional activity was an aspartate. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid have very similar amino acid side chains; they both contain a carboxyl (COOH) group. Based on these results, you would suspect that a carboxyl group at this location in the protein might be important for its function. Describe the rationale underlying the technique of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. [2] A segment of DNA with a protein bound to it will migrate more slowly through a gel than will the same DNA without any bound protein. A shift in a DNA band to a higher molecular mass provides a way to identify DNA binding proteins. Which of the following is the correct function of bacterial transcriptional elongation factor?

How is a karyotype of human cells created? [3] A sample of blood is collected, treated with drugs that stimulate the cells to divide, and subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is discarded, and the cell pellet is suspended in a hypotonic solution. This causes the cells to swell. The sample is subjected to centrifugation a second time to concentrate the cells. The cells are suspended in a fixative, stained, and placed on a slide. Technology + techniques!

[1] Binding profiles What is the difference in profiles of chip-chip and chip-seq, and what does it mean? [2] ChIP-seq has thinner peaks. ChIP\u2013seq reveals specific positions of Chromator binding with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. Describe in detail four issues that input ChIP data may need to increase validity of results and quality of the experimental design. [3] Antibody quality: sensitive + specific gives easier detection to binding events. sample quantity: ~107 cells per experiment. Smaller ranges are possible but require abundant transcription factors. Control experiment: several sources of artefacts, such as not uniform shearing of DNA, repetitive sequences. Depth of sequencing: number of tiling arrays are determined by the investigator. What\u2019s one way of checking reactivity of antibodies with unmodified histones? [1] western blotting What are three commonly used control samples of ChIP? [3] Input DNA (portion of DNA removed prior to immunoprecipitation; mock IP DNA (DNA obtained from IP w/o antibodies); DNA from nonspecific IP (IP performed using an antibody against protein not known to be involved in DNA binding/chromatin modification) What is an artefact of an experiment? [1] Misleading result or distortion that is not a true reflection of the natural phenomenon being studied Can ChIP fragments of sheared DNA be sequenced at both ends, the 5\u2019 and the 3\u2019, or just one end, either the 5\u2019 end or the 3\u2019 end? Why or why not? [2] Generally sequenced at the 5\u2032 ends, they can also be sequenced at both ends, as is frequently done for detection of structural variations in the genome19. Paired-end sequencing can be used in conjunction with ChIP to provide additional specificity (especially when mapping repetitive regions) and to map long-range chromatin interactions List the general eight steps of Hi-C sequencing. [1] Crosslinking, cell lysis, biotin labeling, proximity ligation, reverse crosslinking, library prep, sequencing, data analysis Chromosome conformation capture is a key genomic proximity ligation method utilized in Hi-C. However, there are different types. What are the advantages and disadvantages to 3C, 4C, 5C, and Hi-C? [3] 3C: any two loci w/ PCR; not large scale, low throughput; 4C: circular, and finds genome-wide interactions; on one-loci; 5C: multiple genomic regions; higher throughput; more expensive than 4C & 3C; Hi-C: all genomic interactions; requires large amounts of starting material What\u2019s the procedure of a RNA-seq? [2] experimental design, quality control, read alignment, quantification of gene and transcript levels, visualization, differential gene expression, alternative splicing, functional analysis, gene fusion detection and mapping Mendelian genetics! Gregor Mendel\u2019s Law of Independent Assortment states that genes on different chromosomes segregate independently into gametes. However, when genes are linked, they do not follow this law strictly, and this linkage can be broken by recombination. Suppose a gene A and gene B are located on the same chromosome but 50 megabases apart. In a mapping population, you observe fewer recombinant offspring than expected under true independence. Which of the following is the most plausible genetic explanation for this observation? [1] The two genes experience crossover interference, so a crossover in one region reduces the chance of another nearby. The genes are separated by a large physical distance, but centromeric suppression of crossing over occupies the intervening region. There is negative epistasis between A and B that reduces viability of recombinant gametes. A large inversion exists between A and B preventing recombination in many meioses. The recombinant gametes are formed but suffer meiotic drive against them. Mendel\u2019s Law of Segregation implies that alleles of a gene separate equally into gametes. But several biological phenomena can violate or bias segregation. Which of the following can cause a deviation from the expected 1:1 allele ratio in gametes? Select all that apply: [1] Meiotic drive elements that bias inclusion of one chromosome over its homolog Centromeric \u201csegregation distorters\u201d that interfere with normal segregation machinery Gene conversion during meiosis converting one allele into another Linked lethal alleles that kill gametes carrying one allele Incomplete dominance at a locus altering phenotypic ratios in offspring Mendel\u2019s Third Law (Law of Dominance) assumes alleles are either completely dominant or recessive. Real biology often violates that with incomplete dominance, codominance, or overdominance. In a cross between two plants with red and white flower alleles, the F\u2081 all show pink flowers. In the F\u2082 you observe 1 red : 2 pink : 1 white. This is a classic pattern of _______. [1] Incomplete dominance When you cross two pea plants, each heterozygous for a single gene controlling seed color (Yy \u00d7 Yy), you get a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F\u2082 generation. Suppose instead you cross a plant that is heterozygous for Y (Yy) and for height (Tt) with a homozygous recessive plant (yytt). Which of the following Punnett square genotypic / phenotypic expectations is correct? [1] You set up a 4\u00d74 square with gametes YT, Yt, yT, yt vs yt; you will get 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. You should get a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio because each gamete from YyTt (YT, Yt, yT, yt) has an equal chance and when crossed with only yt, they produce equal classes. You can do two independent monohybrid squares and multiply results; you\u2019ll end up with 3/16 showing dominant for both traits, 3/16 dominant Y only, 3/16 dominant T only, and 1/16 recessive for both. The cross YyTt \u00d7 yytt gives phenotypic ratio 1 dominant Y + dominant T : 1 dominant Y only : 1 dominant T only : 1 recessive both. None of the above You perform a trihybrid cross (AaBbCc \u00d7 AaBbCc) assuming complete dominance at each locus and independent assortment. Which of the following phenotypic ratios or statements about the F\u2082 generation are TRUE? (Select all that apply) The total number of genotype combinations in F\u2082 is 64. The phenotypic ratio across all 8 phenotype classes is 27 : 9 : 9 : 9 : 3 : 3 : 3 : 1. Each of the 8 phenotype classes corresponds to a unique genotype. You could equivalently compute probabilities by doing three independent monohybrid 1:2:1 crosses and multiplying probabilities. A full 8\u00d78 Punnett square is the only valid way to compute F\u2082 outcomes correctly. A three-generation pedigree shows an affected male (proband) whose mother is unaffected, father is unaffected, and the proband has an affected maternal uncle (mother\u2019s brother). Affected individuals are predominantly male; some daughters of unaffected parents are carriers but usually unaffected. Which inheritance model is most consistent with this pedigree? [1] Autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance Autosomal recessive with consanguinity X-linked recessive Mitochondrial inheritance X-linked dominant When evaluating a pedigree to decide whether a trait is autosomal dominant (AD) vs autosomal recessive (AR) vs X-linked recessive (XR), which of the following observations are valid indicators (pick all that apply)? [1] If the trait appears in every generation, it suggests autosomal dominant. If two unaffected parents have an affected child, it suggests autosomal recessive or de novo dominant. If affected fathers transmit the trait to all daughters but no sons, it suggests X-linked recessive. If the trait shows equal frequency in males and females, it rules out X-linked inheritance. If only males are affected across multiple generations and mothers are often carriers, this suggests X-linked recessive. A pedigree shows a single affected male (the proband). His mother is phenotypically unaffected, and she has one affected brother. The father of the proband is unaffected and has no affected relatives. Assume the trait is a single-gene disorder with full penetrance when hemizygous/ homozygous and that the population allele frequency is very low (so ignore unrelated carrier probability). [4] Fill in the blanks below (A\u2013D) with the best answers. The most likely mode of inheritance for this pedigree is (A). The locus is most likely located on the (B) chromosome type. The most likely genotype of the proband\u2019s mother (who is unaffected) is (C). The probability that an unaffected daughter of the proband (assuming she is phenotypically normal and the other parent is unrelated and unaffected) is a carrier is (D). (A) X-linked recessive (B) X chromosome (X-linked) (C) heterozygous carrier (commonly written X\u1d2cX\u1d43 where X\u1d43 = disease allele) (D) 100% In mice, coat color is determined by two loci: C (pigment production: C = functional, c = albino) and B (black vs brown pigment when pigment is produced: B = black, b = brown). The c allele is epistatic to B, meaning that if an animal is cc, no pigment is produced regardless of the B locus genotype. You cross CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. What phenotypic ratio do you expect in the F\u2082 generation? [1] 9 black : 3 brown : 3 albino : 1 albino 9 black : 3 brown : 4 albino 12 albino : 3 black : 1 brown 9 black : 4 albino : 3 brown 9 black : 7 albino : 0 brown Epistasis complicates predictions of genotypic and phenotypic ratios in genetic crosses. Which of the following statements about epistasis and its implications are true? (Select all that apply.) [1] Epistasis can mask the phenotypic effects of alleles at another locus. In recessive epistasis, homozygosity at the epistatic locus masks the phenotype regardless of the second locus. Epistasis always reduces phenotypic diversity in an F\u2082 cross. When epistasis exists, 17:3 and 13:3 ratios are sometimes observed in F\u2082 phenotypes under certain genetic interactions. Epistasis may make two loci behave as if they are in a single locus in a Punnett-square prediction. A trihybrid heterozygote AaBbCc (phase unknown) was testcrossed to aabbcc. The observed progeny (each phenotype corresponds to a gamete from the trihybrid parent) are: [3] Total progeny = 860 Infer gene order, compute map distances between the three genes, and estimate interference. Gene order: A \u2014 B \u2014 C Map distances: A\u2013B = 12.8 cM; B\u2013C = 19.2 cM; A\u2013C = 23.8 cM DCO observed: 35 / 860 = 4.07%; expected DCO = 2.46% \u2192 coefficient of coincidence \u2248 1.66, interference \u2248 \u22120.66. For questions 54-56, use the original mapping function formulas for Haldane (1919) and Kosambi (1944), both of which convert recombination frequency (r) into map distance (d) in centiMorgans. Haldane function: d = -\u00bd ln(1-2r); inverse function: r = \u00bd (1-e-2d) Kosambi function: d = \u00bc ln((1+2r)/(1-2r)); inverse function: r = 1/2tanh(2d) In a genetic cross, the observed recombination frequency between two genes is 0.20 (20%). Using the Haldane mapping function, the corrected map distance in centimorgans (cM) is ___25______ cM, while using the Kosambi mapping function, it is ____19.4_____ cM. Between these two corrections, the _____Kosambi____ function generally gives a shorter map distance at high recombination frequencies because it accounts for ____crossover interference_____. For two intervals, the observed recombination frequencies are 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. Calculate the total corrected map distance (A \u2192 C) under both mapping functions. Fill in the blanks: [2] Using the Haldane function: DH = 15.3 cM Using the Kosambi function: DK = 14.3 cM When the observed recombination frequency between two loci is > 0.25, the Haldane correction yields a map distance that increases (faster/slower) than the observed recombination rate, while the Kosambi correction increases (faster/slower). This difference reflects the biological reality that crossover events are _____non-independent (interfering)____, not purely ____random and independent_____. [4] Mitosis & Meiosis During mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached. Which protein complex directly inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to delay anaphase? [1] Cohesin complex Condensin complex Mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) Cyclin B/CDK1 Shugoshin Which of the following are functions of the spindle assembly checkpoint?

[1] The phragmoplast directs vesicles to build the cell plate Plants have centrosomes identical to animal cells The preprophase band persists throughout mitosis MiMe system occurs naturally in all plants Closed mitosis is the norm in all higher plants The MiMe system in Arabidopsis leads to: [1] Production of diploid gametes via meiosis Production of clonal diploid gametes via mitosis instead of meiosis Polyploid somatic embryos Haploid gametes with increased recombination Formation of apomictic seeds with sexual reproduction During early B cell development in the bone marrow, the assembly of functional immunoglobulin heavy chain genes requires the coordinated action of the recombination-activating gene products RAG1 and RAG2, which recognize conserved recombination signal sequences (RSS) flanking V, D, and J gene segments. This process involves the generation of DNA double-strand breaks, hairpin formation at coding ends, and repair predominantly through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Considering this intricate molecular process, which of the following statements most accurately describes a critical feature of V(D)J recombination that contributes to antigen receptor diversity? The RAG complex introduces single-strand nicks exclusively at the 3\u2032 end of coding sequences, producing staggered ends that are subsequently ligated by homologous recombination machinery, and this mechanism ensures precise sequence conservation across all B cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) adds non-templated nucleotides at the coding junctions after hairpin opening, increasing junctional diversity, while the RAG complex recognizes conserved RSS with a strict 12/23 rule to prevent inappropriate segment joining. Class switch recombination occurs simultaneously with V(D)J rearrangement, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for initiating double-strand breaks within V, D, and J segments, thereby increasing combinatorial diversity. Allelic exclusion is primarily dictated by TdT activity, which ensures that only one allele undergoes somatic hypermutation, thereby preventing expression of multiple heavy chain variants within a single B cell clone. Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) enables B cells to replace the constant region of the heavy chain, allowing the same antigen specificity to be expressed with different effector functions. CSR is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which deaminates cytosines within switch (S) regions upstream of constant region exons. These uracil lesions are processed into DNA double-strand breaks that are subsequently repaired through non-homologous end joining, often influenced by 53BP1 and other DNA damage response factors. Given these molecular events, which of the following statements best reflects the determinants of CSR specificity and efficiency? CSR exclusively targets V region exons and is independent of transcriptional activity or cytokine signaling, with AID recruitment occurring randomly across the genome, resulting in frequent off-target effects. The presence of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at S regions enhances AID recruitment and ensures uniform switching between IgM and all other isotypes without bias, while the repair is mediated solely by homologous recombination pathways. Germline transcription of the target S region, influenced by cytokine signaling (e.g., IL-4 for IgE, TGF-\u03b2 for IgA), establishes chromatin accessibility that directs AID-mediated deamination, and the resolution of DSBs by classical NHEJ determines the predominant isotype outcome. Class switch recombination is initiated exclusively by TdT activity at the V(D)J junction, which both introduces junctional diversity and triggers recruitment of the MRN complex to downstream S regions, thereby coordinating heavy chain switching with somatic hypermutation. During lymphocyte development, junctional diversity generated by nucleotide addition and exonuclease trimming at V(D)J coding joints is a key determinant of the antigen-binding repertoire. TdT activity introduces non-templated nucleotides at coding ends, while exonuclease trimming can remove nucleotides from gene segments prior to ligation. Furthermore, the enforcement of allelic exclusion ensures that only one heavy chain allele and one light chain allele are functionally expressed in each B cell, preventing simultaneous expression of multiple antigen receptor specificities. In this context, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the interplay between these molecular mechanisms in shaping the functional B cell repertoire? TdT-mediated addition of non-templated nucleotides and limited exonuclease trimming at V(D)J junctions increases combinatorial diversity, while feedback inhibition of RAG expression upon successful rearrangement enforces allelic exclusion at the heavy chain locus. Somatic hypermutation of the V region occurs prior to V(D)J recombination, ensuring maximal junctional diversity and allowing RAG1/2 to initiate class switching in the absence of AID. Allelic exclusion is determined entirely by chromatin looping that positions one allele outside the transcriptionally active nuclear compartment, with TdT activity being redundant for generating functional diversity. Junctional diversity is generated only in T cells and does not contribute to B cell antigen specificity, which relies exclusively on combinatorial V(D)J segment selection. Class switch recombination relies on activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which deaminates cytosines in switch (S) regions upstream of constant region exons. The resulting uracils are processed into double-strand breaks that are repaired by NHEJ, allowing recombination between S regions and enabling expression of different Ig isotypes. Which statement best describes the regulation and outcome of AID-mediated CSR? AID randomly deaminates cytosines across the genome, initiating CSR without regard for transcriptional activity or cytokine signaling. CSR is targeted to actively transcribed S regions, with cytokines such as IL-4 or TGF-\u03b2 directing isotype choice, and DSB repair by NHEJ finalizes recombination. AID initiates recombination at V(D)J coding segments during B cell development, ensuring junctional diversity before heavy chain isotype switching. TdT activity replaces the AID function during CSR to insert non-templated nucleotides in S regions, which dictates IgG versus IgA expression. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations into the variable regions of Ig genes at rates ~10-3 per base pair per division, increasing antigen-binding diversity. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) converts cytosines to uracils, which are then processed by error-prone repair pathways. Which statement best describes the SHM mechanism? SHM occurs in constant regions and is initiated by TdT to diversify heavy chain isotypes. SHM targets V region exons via AID-mediated cytosine deamination, followed by error-prone base excision and mismatch repair, generating point mutations that alter antigen specificity. SHM occurs before V(D)J recombination and is required to generate functional heavy chains. AID introduces deletions in S regions to trigger hypermutation exclusively in the light chain loci. AID initiates class switch recombination by deaminating cytosines in switch (S) regions, creating U:G mismatches that are processed into double-strand breaks. These breaks are repaired by NHEJ, allowing recombination between S regions. Which statement accurately describes how AID contributes to Ig isotype diversity? AID randomly mutates V(D)J exons to generate diversity before CSR. AID functions exclusively in T cells to promote TCR diversity. AID replaces the TdT function during V(D)J recombination to insert non-templated nucleotides in S regions. AID targets transcribed S regions, guided by cytokine-induced germline transcription, leading to isotype-specific DSB formation and recombination. Regulators and contributors to AID activity in CSR: Germline transcription of S regions Cytokines directing isotype choice Recruitment of 53BP1 and ATM for DSB repair TdT-mediated junctional addition at V(D)J ends Chromatin accessibility via histone modifications Switch regions are repetitive DNA sequences upstream of constant region exons that guide class switch recombination. The DNA is targeted by AID, and repair of DSBs leads to replacement of C\u03bc with downstream C\u03b3, C\u03b5, or C\u03b1 exons. Which statement correctly describes S region function? S regions provide repetitive DNA targets for AID-mediated deamination, facilitating DSB formation and recombination between different constant region exons. S regions encode variable region diversity and are not involved in CSR. S regions are transcribed only after B cell activation, without influence on CSR specificity. S regions are bound by TdT to introduce N-nucleotide diversity during isotype switching. During B cell development, light chain recombination occurs sequentially, with \u03ba locus rearranged before \u03bb locus. The choice of light chain affects antigen receptor specificity, allelic exclusion, and receptor editing if initial rearrangement is non-productive. Which statement accurately describes the molecular basis of \u03ba versus \u03bb recombination? \u03ba light chain genes are preferentially rearranged first, with \u03bb rearrangement occurring only if \u03ba alleles fail, and RAG1/2-mediated cleavage follows the 12/23 rule at V\u03ba and J\u03ba segments. \u03bb light chain rearrangement occurs prior to \u03ba rearrangement in all B cells to maximize receptor diversity. \u03ba and \u03bb loci recombine simultaneously in the same B cell, and TdT activity enforces allelic exclusion between them. \u03bb light chain genes are only expressed in memory B cells after somatic hypermutation of \u03ba chains. During affinity maturation, (A) introduces mutations in (B), B cells with improved (C) are selected in (D), and (E) ensures expansion of high-affinity clones.

Genetic drift in small populations Selection for specific genotypes Non-random mating such as inbreeding Migration introducing new alleles Mutation introducing new alleles In a population of 1000 individuals, allele A has frequency p = 0.6 and allele a has frequency q = 0.4. Under HWE, the expected genotype counts are: AA = (A), Aa = (B), aa = (C). If selection removes 50% of AA individuals, new allele frequency of A becomes (D). [4] (A) 360, (B) 480, (C) = 160, (D) = 0.54 In an F2 population, mean of parents = 100, F1 mean = 110, F2 variance = 36, environmental variance = 9.

(A) 0.75, (B) 0.5-0.6, (C) = 3-4 loci, (D) = 92-128 Gene duplication provides raw material for evolution; duplicated genes may diverge to create paralogs, while orthologs exist between species. Which statement correctly describes this evolutionary mechanism? Only orthologs can generate new gene functions. Gene duplication creates paralogs within a genome; divergence can produce new functions, while orthologs retain function across species. Paralogs are identical copies without divergence. Duplication events have no evolutionary consequences. Gene duplication generates (A), which can diverge into (B) with new functions, while (C) maintains function across species. Evolutionary fates include (D) and (E).

The total phenotypic variance in leaf size is observed to be Vp = 100, with additive genetic variance Va = 40 and dominance plus epistatic variance Vd + Vi = 20. To increase leaf size, the scientists select the largest plants from the population, resulting in a selection differential S = 10. After one generation, the average increase in leaf size (response to selection) R = 6. Calculate the following: Broad-sense heritability H\u00b2 = (A) Narrow-sense heritability h\u00b2 = (B) Realized heritability h\u00b2 = (C) Proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive effects = (D) (A) 0.6, (B) 0.4, (C) 0.6, (D) 0.4 A small island population of Gal\u00e1pagos finches is founded by 10 birds from a mainland population. One allele, A, controls beak depth and is initially at frequency p=0.8. After a few generations, what is a likely consequence of random sampling in this small population? Likely fixation or loss of alleles (genetic drift) If a hurricane kills half of the population randomly, how does allele frequency change? Allele frequency will shift randomly; heterozygosity may decrease. Researchers are constructing a phylogeny of wild tomato species using nuclear genes, mitochondrial sequences, and plasmid-derived sequences from bacterial endophytes. Which type of sequence reflects maternal lineage? Mitochondrial DNA Which sequence may indicate horizontal gene transfer? Plasmid sequences Which is best for general species-level phylogeny? Nuclear genes In a controlled experimental evolution study, researchers are investigating floral scent intensity in a population of Nicotiana attenuata (wild tobacco), a trait influenced by multiple loci, epistatic interactions, and environmental cues such as temperature and soil nutrient availability. Over several generations, they measure phenotypic variance (Vp) in volatile compound emission, and partition it into additive genetic variance (Va), dominance variance (Vd), and epistatic variance (Vi) using a combination of full-sib/half-sib crossing designs and replicated common garden experiments. The researchers then perform directional selection for increased emission of benzyl acetone, calculating the selection differential (S) and the resulting response to selection (R) after one generation. Vp = 120 (ng/flower/hr)2 Va = 50 (ng/flower/hr)2 Vd + vi = 30 (ng/flower/hr)2 Selection differential S = 8 ng/flower/hr Observed response to selection R = 4.8 ng/flower/hr Calculate the broad-sense heritability (H\u00b2) of benzyl acetone emission.",

    "answer": "(4 points) Determine the proportion of a certain species of seals that has the dominant phenotype if proportion of the dominant allele is 0.6 given Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? Give your answer in the form of a decimal. p = 0.6 \u2192 which must mean q = 0.4 given that p + q = 1. To calculate the proportion of dominant phenotypes (p^2 + 2pq), we use the Hardy-Weinberg equation of p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. q^2 = 0.16, so p^2 + 2pq = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84 Full or no credit if the answer of 0.84 is given. 6",

What nucleic acid is created when cytosine is deaminated? Uracil Before I could fix the issue, my cell replicated its DNA and divided without correction. With my perfect knowledge of my cytosine deaminases activity, I know only one nucleic acid was changed before replication, on the template strand. b. After division, how many mutations will each daughter cell have? Only one in one of the cells, the other is left untouched We already have one mutation going into replication, but we can be fairly certain that no other ones will accumulate during replication. This is due to several tricks that occur during replication. c. (Two points) From binding to initial incorporation, two selective steps are required to incorporate an amino acid. How do both contribute to selectivity? Closing of binding pocket, and catalytic activity. d. While both provide selectivity, the second step is especially important by enhancing selectivity beyond the small hydrogen bond energy difference. What allows for this second step to enforce affinity specificity beyond naive binding? Second binding/use of external energy e. As if all this wasn\u2019t enough, the typical DNA polymerase used in your cells also has this domain to further ensure nothing goes wrong. What is this domain called? Exonuclease f. (4 points) Throughout replication strands will be unwound, bound by external proteins and topological stress will be released, while the new DNA on the lagging strand is stitched together. What are the actors involved in each of these steps and in what order 8 do they begin work (variations accepted for late actors)? Helicase, Single-Strand Binding Proteins, Topoisomerase <-> Ligase. The situation just keeps worsening, as the mutated strand has just been recruited to make a protein. Much to my chagrin, I don\u2019t have knowledge of which cytosine was mutated.. With this in mind, help me work out the possibilities. Assume all associated mutations in the coding strand are to A instead of G (0.5 point each). g. If the first underlined letter is modified, what type of mutation would I end up getting? Nonsense. h. The second? Nonsense. i. The third? Silent. j. The fourth? (Conservative) missense (give them a gold star or something if they say conservative) After it is too late, the DNA glycolases sense something is up. They call on a repair pathway nicknamed BER to repair the damage. k. (3 points) What is BER short for and what two pathways can it take? Base Excision Repair, long/short patch",

They determine when and where a gene is expressed. Enhancers: Regulatory DNA elements that can increase transcription levels of target genes, often from long distances and in an orientation-independent manner. They function by binding activator proteins that interact with the transcription machinery. Silencers: DNA elements that repress transcription by binding repressor proteins. They reduce or completely shut down expression of target genes, sometimes over long distances. Riboswitches: Regulatory RNA segments, typically found in the 5\u2032 UTR of bacterial mRNAs, that change structure upon binding a small metabolite. This conformational change can activate or inhibit transcription or translation. Transcription Factors: Proteins that bind specific DNA sequences to regulate transcription by recruiting or blocking RNA polymerase. They can act as activators or repressors depending on context. 2 points/term for each correct answer 1 points/term for partial correct answer 0 points/term for no answer or fully incorrect",
